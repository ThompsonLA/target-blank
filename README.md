- [Coming up with an official name](https://github.com/kerrykimrusso/target-blank/issues/10)
- New feature suggestions/current feature fixes

**Most importantly, we *need* to know if certain behavior isn't working as expected on specific sites.**

If you are able, report bugs and unexpected behavior by contributing with issues ([see below](#contributing)). Otherwise, questions/comments/suggestions/compliments/virtual hugs can be directed to targetdashblank@gmail.com.
